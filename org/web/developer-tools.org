Read and writes should, in principle, be batched. This is rarely
possible. So check into 

- window.requestAnimationFrame();

- fastdom, which eliminates layout thrashing by batching DOM measurement and
mutation tasks.

To profile, remember you only want a few seconds.

Performance. Record (3 seconds.)

You can use w,s,a,d, to zoom in/out, left/right, in main (CPU) thread.

Find a wide block and then look for the longest lowest function call
before it. It is the likely cause.

* Memory (Leaks)

With setInterval be sure to set it to variable and clear it.

In DevTools, Performance is good for spotting memory issue.
Memory is good for figuring out why.

Go to performance and allow app to run for several seconds.
