* Publishing
cd dist
Note: This doesn't add beta to version. You'll still have to bump
version afterward.

npm publish --access public --dry-run
npm publish --tag beta --access public

Currently, issues with npm build, jest, being left in package.json
So I'm manually deleting these. Need to figure out a better process.


* Linking
if you have package my-package you want to link globally, navigate to that directory:
No need to add anything else:
$ npm link

Then if you want to use that package as a module, go to that directory
And instead of npm installing, simply
$ npm link my-package
