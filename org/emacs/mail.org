settings are in offlineimaprc



So I don't know ideal setup but here is how to do it:

For some sort of syncing:
offlineimap

Then to see changes inside emacs (mu4e) run:
mu index --maildir=~/.Mail


Figure out why this works.

checkout ~/.mail as well

Hypothesis: mu4e runs mu index, but VERY slowly. Need to determine if this is true.

And still sending emails has only worked one time. It happened right after shutting down thunderbird, but this may have been a coincidence.
